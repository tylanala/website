## Projects 
Here are some projects I completed during the Spring 2020 semester at UT for Computational Biology:

- [Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse Tools: Scary Movies Aren't Rated as Well as You Think](/project1/)

- [Modeling, Testing, and Classification: College Tuition Throughout the USA](/project2/)

I honestly had a lot of fun and learned a lot doing these projects. I want to give a special thanks to Nathaniel Woodward for being one of the **best** (and quite possibly my favorite) professors I've ever had at UT! I never had a professor that was as caring and engaging with his/her students as he was. Also, shoutout to Maria the chicken to making classes on Zoom that much better!
