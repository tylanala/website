## About:

![](/./about_files/grad.jpg)

Hiya there! My name is Tylana. I was born and raised in Houston, TX and have *loved* living in Austin the last 4 years for college. I'm excited graduate this May from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science and Arts in Biology. Soon, I'll be starting graduate school at the University of North Texas Health Science Center to pursue a Masters in Medical Sciences, the next stepping stone for me to (hopefully!!) get into medical school! I dream I'll be a pediatrician, one day, or perhaps something completely different, who knows! 

Some important facts you should about me: french fries are my **FAVORITE** food, I love Taylor Swift, and if I could adopt all the dogs in the world, I would (even though I'm allergic to them ðŸ˜”). In fact, here's a cute photo of my dog Walnut.

In my free time, I enjoy reading a good book (although it's been a hot minute since I've *actually* picked one up), going on nice walks with Walnut and watching YouTube/Netflix. Some of my favorite books include "Juliet" by Anne Fortier, "I Am the Messenger" by Markus Zusak, and "Find Her" by Lisa Gardner. My favorite shows include *Criminal Minds*, *Grey's Anatomy*, *Hawaii Five-0*, and *Chicago Med*. And I'm currently watching *Dead to Me* and rewatching *Glee* (I don't know why, I just really wanted to). If you look into some of the shows/books, you'll find out, I love a good mystery, something crime or medical related, and LOTS of drama.

I also love to listening to music! As I mentioned above, I LOVE Taylor Swift (the haters can leave haha), but I also love listening to Dua Lipa, Ariana Grande and a lot of smaller artists like Oh Wonder and Katelyn Tarver. 

That's pretty much it! Thanks for getting to know me!
