<p>My years in undergrad are coming to an end. I‚Äôve had a lot of good times and some <em>not so good</em> ones (organic chemistry, you have left me scarred üòñ). I‚Äôm ready to close this chapter in my life and move on to the next. But before I go, I want to reminisce on some of my favorite moments from college using R and Python (afterall, I have one last very important project to do before undergrad is <strong><em>actually</em></strong> over).</p>
<p>First off, let me explain how all this <em>coding</em> works. The ‚Äúreticulate‚Äù package I‚Äôve called for allows Python and R to interact in one place. So this first chunk is in R and I assign what time I‚Äôm talking about to the ‚Äútime‚Äù object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
time1&lt;-&quot;When I first joined college,&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Then, in this next chunk, which is now Python, I assign my memory to the memory object, which will be different for each memory I‚Äôm talking about; but in this case, its ‚Äúspo‚Äù. At the end of this chunk, I tell R and Python to interact, using the command ‚Äúprint(r.‚Äùr object‚Äú,‚Äùpython object‚Äú)‚Äù to get the full message, which will output into a separate chunk. I do this exact process for the rest of my memories, so enjoy reading some of my favorite moments in college!</p>
<pre class="python"><code>spo=&quot;I never thought I would join a sorority. But in my first semester here, that&#39;s what I did! I met my line sisters and mom, who are the craziest bunch of people I&#39;ve met. That first semester was a wild one, and I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to do it with any other group of girls. To all the late nights and all the fun nights, I won&#39;t forget them.  And I also got a big sis and a big bro, both of whom I hold near and dear to my heart. They have supported me through every step of my LABORIOUS pre-med journey (which is still going) with lots of food/boba and lots of love. Thank you for everything!&quot;

<pre class="python"><code>spo2=&quot;I&#39;ve been lucky enough to give back to my sorority. Last year, I got to be one of the philanthropy directors and helped raise awareness for domestic violence. My co-chair and I raised almost $2000, along with some homemade care packages, to donate to SAFE (Stop Abuse For Everyone). Then, in this past year, I was honored to be Vice President. I got to help run a whole freaking organization! But my favorite thing was planning events to promote sisterhood. I value being able to be VP and have learned a lot through the experience of both positions. Thanks to Sigmas for everything.&quot;

I&#39;m ready to move on to the next chapter in my life (hopefully medical school soon!!). This might be the end of college, but this isnt the end of all these friendships I&#39;ve made.
