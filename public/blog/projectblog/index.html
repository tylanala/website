<p>My years in undergrad are coming to an end. I‚Äôve had a lot of good times and some <em>not so good</em> ones (organic chemistry, you have left me scarred üòñ). I‚Äôm ready to close this chapter in my life and move on to the next. But before I go, I want to reminisce on some of my favorite moments from college using R and Python (afterall, I have one last very important project to do before undergrad is <strong><em>actually</em></strong> over).</p>
<p>First off, let me explain how all this <em>coding</em> works. The ‚Äúreticulate‚Äù package I‚Äôve called for allows Python and R to interact in one place. So this first chunk is in R and I assign what time I‚Äôm talking about to the ‚Äútime‚Äù object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
time1&lt;-&quot;When I first joined college,&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Then, in this next chunk, which is now Python, I assign my memory to the memory object, which will be different for each memory I‚Äôm talking about; but in this case, its ‚Äúspo‚Äù. At the end of this chunk, I tell R and Python to interact, using the command ‚Äúprint(r.‚Äùr object‚Äú,‚Äùpython object‚Äú)‚Äù to get the full message, which will output into a separate chunk. I do this exact process for the rest of my memories, so enjoy reading some of my favorite moments in college!</p>
<pre class="python"><code>spo=&quot;I never thought I would join a sorority. But in my first semester here, that&#39;s what I did! I met my line sisters and mom, who are the craziest bunch of people I&#39;ve met. That first semester was a wild one, and I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to do it with any other group of girls. To all the late nights and all the fun nights, I won&#39;t forget them.  And I also got a big sis and a big bro, both of whom I hold near and dear to my heart. They have supported me through every step of my LABORIOUS pre-med journey (which is still going) with lots of food/boba and lots of love. Thank you for everything!&quot;
