      <description>Projects Here are some projects I completed during the Spring 2020 semester at UT for Computational Biology:
 Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse Tools: Scary Movies Aren&amp;rsquo;t Rated as Well as You Think   Modeling, Testing, and Classification: College Tuition Throughout the USA  I honestly had a lot of fun and learned a lot doing these projects. I want to give a special thanks to Nathaniel Woodward for being one of the best (and quite possibly my favorite) professors I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had at UT!</description>
